# DraftInteractive

### Interactive Storytelling

My project currently called Draft is about providing a product or service that encourages gradual improvement for creative writing and freestyle. This in hope will inspire creativity and be an alternative interactive learning process that can be used. This pertains to writers or having an interest in writing.

How to get it working

Database with all the Databases 

```
source venv/bin/activate

python app/database/tester.py

sqlite_web database.db
```

Databse with the foreign linkage

```
source venv/bin/activate

python app/database/plotline.py

sqlite_web my-database.db 
```

### Lists of Tables

* Table of Story (Dynamic)

* Table of Characters (Dynamic)

* Table of Paragraph (Dynamic)

* Table of Plotline (Fixed)

* Table of Roles (Fixed)

* Table of Archetype (Fixed)

* Table of Phase (Fixed)

### Story(Dynamic)

This is populated by the user.
Name of  Story
New Story Created.
In a created Story, it contains the Paragraphs created by the user through forms, the Characters created by the user through forms and the plot lines chosen by the user which is fixed.

Parent to

Prose
Text Based
Contains Paragraphs the user creates
|Links to Character| Story| Phase|

Character
Contains Name generated by User
Can choose Role (FIXED)
Paragraph contains characters

Saved under one Story

Settings


Phase (Fixed)
Contains subplots 
Depending on the plot line chosen associated subplots will be used
Characters created (roles) interact with subplots (1 character for 1 subplot) Dif Perspective

|Links to Character| Plotlines|

Role (Fixed)
Roles are fixed 
List of all the character roles

Rundown on how it will be connected

Schema Design for Interactive Storytelling

Simple SQL schema 
Tables with Primary keys and foreign keys 
No complicated linkage part from 1 Table that has 3 keys(Phase, Role, Plotline)

Schema divides into data that is completely Fixed (entire application) and Dynamic (created by the user). There are 4 completely fixed and 3 dynamic.

Table of Plotlines (7)
Potenital plots and templates 
Completely fixed user is required to pick a plot line 

Character of a story
There is a role for the character
the roles are completely fixed

As the story is written it goes through a set of phases and these phases are completely fixed

Dynamic in the schema 
You have stories
Create story with a name
The stories have to pick from a plot line 
Many to one relationships between story and plotline

Plotline has an ID the story has a foreign key linkage into the Plotline
As stories are built up there will be one plot line per story, potentially several stories could be on the same plot line(made by same user or made by someone different)

Stories have characters
Stories can have more than one character 
Every character has a preset role
Foreign key character that goes to primary key in role
(Potentially more than one character with a single role)
More than one hero and more than one villain, and might have no character for a particular role

Linkage from character to story which is many to one relationship
Story can have 1 or more characters 
Many to one linkage from character to role because every character has a role and the roles are preset 

Having set that up the user then gets to start writing paragraphs of text, 
got a table called prose where each entry in the table is a block of text
Every text paragraph is written form the point of view of a character  in a certain role

And the narrative voice switches between characters or between roles as the story progress
Linkage needed
If we link from each block/ entry of prose into the character  whose voice is speaking it that is many to one because the character may actually drop into the story more than once and have  more than one block of text 
from character we know we can get to the role of the character and we can get to the story and we can get to the plotline

These block of prose each associated with a phase of the story and again the phases are completely fixed and you work through phases as the stories get written 
The phases vary according to plot line, different plot line have to have different phases and each phase is associated with a role so the first phase is a certain role like hero, second could be villain, third could be something else.
So when I say a Line of text is written from the point of view of a character it has has to be a character of the correct role for the story according to the phase of the story 

Potentially when you are writing from a certain block of text you know what role it has to be 
Written in, which voice, because we know which phase of the story we are in because we are progressing through the phase if there is one character who has that role then you are telling the story from that characters point of view, if there is more than one character it could be a choice given to the user, right you are now in phase three you want  to write from the role of the villain and you have two villains so you need to  pick which one you want to write from 

Then the remaining bit of the Schema which we havenâ€™t talked about is
How we link plot lines roles and phases
Given a plot line, that tells us what phases we go through and then for every phase we have a role for the character whose voice we are going to use.
We have a table here which is a table of 3 , foreign keys for plot, phase and role.

Given the plot line you can filter that table down, so that gives you phases and roles, as you work through the phases  that gives you the role you need to pick out for that phases and plot line in order to allow selection of the character and to have that block of text entered.
